## Questions and goals
- Understand the anatomy of a tumor, similar to the anatomy of a normal tissue
    - [Interstitial Fluid Flow and Drug Delivery in Vascularized Tumors: A Computational Model](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070395)
    - _CMTI_, _Klabunde_, _SHK_, _AWR_
- [Understand the current status of viral therapies of cancer](./viral-therapies.md)
    - Can synthetic biology in viral carriers form targeted therapies?
- How can we specifically target cancer cells? [^target1]

## Textbooks
1. Cancer Microenvironment and Therapeutic Implications (CMTI)
2. Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts (Klabunde)
3. Capillary Fluid Exchange: Regulation, Functions, and Pathology (SHK)
4. Molecular Biology of Cancer (Pecorino)
5. Biomarkers of the tumor microenvironment: basic studies and practical applications (Akslen, Watnick, Randolph; AWR)
