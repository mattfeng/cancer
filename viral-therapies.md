## Choosing a viral vector

### Types of viral vectors
- oncolytic adenoviruses
- type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV)
- polioviruses
- measles virus (MV)
- Newcastle disease virus (NDV)
- reoviruses
- vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
- Zika virus
- coxsackievirus

### Criteria
- RNA viruses generally kill cancer cells faster than DNA viruses because they do not need to enter the nucleus
    - they are less tumor-selective
- enveloped viruses are less efficient than naked viruses
- enveloped viruses are more likely to be cleared by the immune system
- smaller viruses are better able to diffuse through a tumor
- larger viruses are better able to encode therapeutic genes
- other factors (**TODO**) [^zheng22]
    - tumor tropism
    - potential pathogenicity
    - immunogenicity
    - druggability
    - viral stability
