# Tumor profiling

**Tumor profiling** for cancer treatment is the process of looking at the DNA and proteins in cancer cells to learn more about the _specific causes of cancer_. The pieces of DNA and proteins analyzed are called **biomarkers**.

Tumor profiling is also known as:

- biomarker testing
- tumor testing
- tumor genetic testing
- genomic testing
- genomic profiling
- molecular testing
- molecular profiling
- somatic testing
- tumor subtyping
