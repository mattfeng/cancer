# Tumor profiling

**Tumor profiling** for cancer treatment is the process of looking at the DNA and proteins in cancer cells to learn more about the _specific causes of cancer_. The pieces of DNA and proteins analyzed are called **biomarkers**.[^1] Tumor profiling is the first step in finding a **targeted therapy** because it can help reveal the molecular pathway that is driving cancer.

It often takes _two to three weeks_ to get results.[^2]

Tumor profiling is also known as:[^1]

- biomarker testing
- tumor testing
- tumor genetic testing
- genomic testing
- genomic profiling
- molecular testing
- molecular profiling
- somatic testing
- tumor subtyping

## When is tumor profiling most useful?
Lung cancer, colon cancer, sarcoma, and melanoma have the most number of targeted therapies. Tumor profiling is less useful for cancers that do not have developed targeted therapies.[^2] Regardless, tumor profiling is recommended in the event that a new, relevant clinical trial for a targeted therapy begins.

## Liquid vs. solid biopsies

Solid tumors include the following types of cancer:
  - lung
  - colon
  - breast
  - melanoma
  - gastic
  - ovarian.

A **liquid biopsy** takes a sample from your _blood_ and/or _urine_ and analyzes it for biomarkers such as ctDNA. It is used if you have a blood cancer or if getting a solid tumor biopsy is not possible.

As of 2017, liquid biopsies are still not sensitive for detecting mutations in:[^4]
  - pancreatic cancer.
