# Solving cancer

## Introduction
Cancer is a disorder of genes driven by the **development of genomic instability.**

## Definitions
- **homeostatic proliferation.** a normal physiological process triggered by
  lymphopenia to maintain a constant level of T-cells
- **neoepitope.** an epitope the body has not encountered before
- **necroptosis.** programmed inflammatory cell death
- **ferroptosis.**

## Notes
- Cancers develop over the course of 7 to 10 years before recognized clinically
  - Individual loss of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
  - immune editing of particular oncogene mutations (eg, p53)
  - immune infiltrate characterized by
    - tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
    - tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (TIDCs)
- escape from immune control is a hallmark of cancer
- research into original treatments revealed that they were being limited by
  - regulatory mechanisms for controlling immune activation
  - a potent immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment

## Treatments
- Interferon
- IL2
- Lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK cells)

## Biology

### Cellular processes
- Programmed cell death
  - Apoptosis
  - Necroptosis
  - Ferroptosis
- Programmed cell survival
  - Autophagy

- Immunosuppressive factors
  - Cells
  - Cytokines
  - Proteins (immune checkpoints)
    - programmed death 1 (PD-1)
    - programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
- damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs)

### DNA
- pseudo-autosomal regions

## Bioinformatics
- Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)
  - maps low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome
- Hierarchical Indexing for Spliced Alignment of Transcripts (HISAT2)
  - alignment program for mapping NGS reads to a population or single human genome
  - based on [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TCBB.2013.2297101)
  - has its [own paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0201-4)
